# Tic-Tac-Toe with Python

This project is a command-line implementation of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe programmed using Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It allows two players to take turns and compete against each other to achieve 3-in-a-row with either naughts (`O`) or crosses (`X`). The program is optimised to run in the terminal command line for clean and aesthetic text displays that refresh accordingly. 

## Project Files
1. `main.py`: Initialises and handles the game logic by utilising and implementing all definied game objects, attributes and their methods. 
2. `tictactoe_classes.py`: Contains definitions of essential classes to represent players, the board and game statistics for use in the main program logic.
